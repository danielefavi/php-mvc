# php-mvc
A lightweight PHP MVC framework made for fun!

This MVC has a structure similar to Laravel. So, in case your application grows then the porting from this MVC to Laravel it will be not hard.
*Note:* instead to use the built in ORM you can pull-in the Eloquent in the framework. Then if you want to migrate your app to Laravel it will be much easier.

# When you should use it?
When your server is slow or you have to host the app on a shared server where Laravel does not work. Otherwise I suggest you to use Laravel :)

# Quickstart
- Clone or download the framework.
- Run the command:
```sh
composer install
```
- Rename the file **config-sample.php** to **config.php**.
- In the **config.php** file change the database configuration and login configuration.
- If you want to try the demo import the database from the file **database_sample.sql**
